          <h2>Python</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Python is a great language to start out with, here is an example snippet of python code:</p>
        <code>world = "world" print("hello " + world)</code>
        <p>Python has become a staple in data science, allowing data analysts and other professionals to use the language to conduct complex statistical calculations, create data visualizations, build machine learning algorithms, manipulate and analyze data, and complete other data-related tasks.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In December 1989, Python’s creator Guido Van Rossum was looking for a hobby project to keep him occupied in the week around Christmas. He had been thinking of writing a new scripting language that’d be a descendant of ABC and also appeal to Unix/C hackers. He chose to call it Python.</li>
          <li>The language’s name isn’t about snakes, but about the popular British comedy troupe Monty Python (from the 1970s). Guido himself is a big fan of Monty Python’s Flying Circus. Being in a rather irreverent mood, he named the project ‘Python’. Isn’t it an interesting Python fact?</li>

          <h2>C#</h2>
        </header>
        <p>C# is a great language to start out with, here is an example snippet of C# code!</p>
        <code>class Hello {static void Main(string[] args){System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");}}</code>
        <p>C# is a programming language that is remarkably scalable and easy to maintain. Because of the strict nature of how static codes must be written, C# programs are reliably consistent, which makes them much easier to adjust and maintain than programs that are written using other languages.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The name of the C Sharp language is stimulated by the musical notation. Here sharp, represent the written note which should be made a semitone higher in pitch.</li>
          <li>C# is an object-oriented language that is based on C++ and Java. It combines the power and flexibility of C++ with the simplicity and ease of use of Java.</li>

          <h2>HTML</h2>
        </header>
        <p>HTML is a great language to start with and is used to create content on web pages!</p>
        <code>
          < p>hello world< /p>
        </code>
        <p>HTML helps you understand how to make things more accessible. Semantic HTML tags form the basis for good accessibility practices, as they allow screen readers to determine where different elements are on a web page and how they're formatted. Learning how to make your website accessible is crucial.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for 'Hyper Text Markup Language'.</li>
          <li>If you apply a type of "email" to form inputs, you can instruct the browser to only allow strings that conform to a valid email address structure.</li>
        </ul>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
        </header>
        <p>CSS is used to style content on web pages!</p>
        <code>body { background-color: blue; }</code>
        <p>CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS was first intended in 1994 by Håkon Wium Lie while working at CERN with a computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee.</li>
          <li>Without using CSS, it is very typical thing for web designers to lay out their pages with techniques like HTML tables that obstruct accessibility for the vision-impaired users</li>
        </ul>

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        </header>
        <p>JavaScript is a great language to start with and is frequently used on web pages!</p>
        <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } greetMe("World");</code>
        <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 when he was working for Netscape Communications Corporation, creator of the legendary web browser, Netscape Navigator. At the time, Java was gaining popularity, but it was too large and complex a technology to reach novice designers.</li>
          <li>JavaScript works well with other languages and can be used in many applications.</li>
